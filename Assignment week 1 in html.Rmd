# INTRODUCTION

#This the project of an  Week 1 assignment in R Programming of My Data Science Intership
# at @ZenoTalent <https://www.linkedin.com/company/neozenotalent/posts/?feedView=all> with my 
# Mentor Aishwary <https://www.linkedin.com/in/aishwarya-s-b48038223/> & This assignment helped
#me strengthen my skills in vectors, data operations, conditional filtering, and plotting in R.
#It was a valuable hands-on experience in applying R programming to real-world data insights.
#In this project, I analyzed 10 weeks of average temperature data for the cities of Nellore and 
#Vizag. The temperature values were manually gathered using #Google Weather Forecast as a reference.
#I used R to visualize these trends through line plots, giving a clear picture of how 
#temperatures varied week by week. To simulate real-world scenarios, I introduced a +2°C increase 
#to the existing data—representing a heatwave—for both cities. 
#This allowed me to compare normal and extreme temperature patterns side by side.

#Nellore Temperature Trends
#1. Creating a numeric vector containing 10 weekly average temperatures in Celsius
temp_nlr <- c(28, 31, 33, 39, 27, 35.2, 36, 30, 32.6, 34)
temp_nlr

#2.Creating a character vector representing weeks
week <- sprintf("Week %d", 1:10)# using namesis a formatting function in R
#week <- sprintf("Week %02d", 1:10) #zero paddling
#
week
names(temp_nlr) <- week
temp_nlr 
#lengthof
weeks <- paste("Week",1:10)
names(temp_nlr) <- weeks
temp_nlr

#3.1
mean(temp_nlr)# Average Temperature 
max(temp_nlr) # Maxinum Temperature
min(temp_nlr) # Miminum Temperature

#3.2 Counting number of weeks with temperature above 30 dC
above30 <- sum(temp_nlr > 30) # using addition for seleted temperature above 30
above30

#3.3 Extracting week names where temperature is between 25dC and 35dC
data_nlr <- names(temp_nlr[temp_nlr >= 25 & temp_nlr <= 35]) #This line filters the temp_data vector for values b/w 25°C and 35°C and extracts their corresponding week names using the names() function 
data_nlr

#4. Adding 2dC to all temperatures to simulate a heatwave
heatwave_temp_nlr <- temp_nlr + 2 # adding 2 to the values of temp_nlr
heatwave_temp_nlr

# Vizag Temperature Trends
#1 Creating a numeric vector containing 10 weekly average temperatures in Celsius
temp_viz <- c(30.3, 29.5, 33.3, 35.2, 31, 37.3, 36.7, 33.8, 28, 32)
temp_viz

#2. Creating a character vector representing weeks
names(temp_viz) <- sprintf("Week %d", 1:10)
temp_viz

#3.1
mean(temp_viz) # Average Temperature 
max(temp_viz) #  Maxinum Temperature
min(temp_viz) #  Miminum Temperature

#3.2 Counting number of weeks with temperature above 30 dC
above30_viz <- sum(temp_viz > 30)
above30_viz

#3.3 Extracting week names where temperature is between 25dC and 35dC
data_viz <- names(temp_viz[temp_viz >= 25 & temp_viz <= 35])
data_viz

#4 Adding 2dC to all temperatures to simulate a heatwave
heatwave_temp_viz <- temp_viz + 2
heatwave_temp_viz
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{}, echo=FALSE}
#Heatwave simulation for Nellore 
plotting the temperature of Nellore and Nellore Heat Waves 
plot(heatwave_temp_nlr,type = 'o', col='red',xlab = "week", ylab = "heatwave_temp_nlr", main = "Nellore Temperature Trends of 10 Weeks")
points(temp_nlr,type = 'o', col= 'black')
legend("topright",c("temp_nlr","heatwave_temp_nlr"), fill=c("red","black"))

#Heatwave simulation for Vizag
plotting the temperature of Vizag and Vizag Heat Waves 
plot(heatwave_temp_viz,type = 'o', col='green',xlab = "week", ylab = "heatwave_temp_viz", main = "Vizag Temperature Trends of 10 Weeks")
points(temp_viz,type = 'o', col= 'blue')
legend("topright",c("temp_viz","heatwave_temp_viz"), fill=c("green","blue"))

#  Comparing Temperature Trends of Nellore and Vizag Over 10 Weeks Including Heatwave Simulation (+2°C)
plot(heatwave_temp_nlr,type = 'o', col='red',xlab = "week", ylab = "heatwave_temp_nlr", main = "Comparing Temperature Trends of Nellore and Vizag")
points(heatwave_temp_viz,type = 'o',col='green')
points(temp_nlr,type = 'o', col= 'black')
points(temp_viz,type = 'o', col= 'blue')
legend("topleft",c("temp_nlr","heatwave_temp_nl","temp_viz","heatwave_temp_viz"), fill=c("red","black","green","blue"))

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
